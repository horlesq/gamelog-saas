# Sync OSS changes INTO this SaaS repo
git fetch oss
git merge oss/main --allow-unrelated-histories
# Resolve any conflicts (SaaS-specific files vs OSS changes)
git push origin main   # pushes only to gamelog-saas (private)

# NOTE: pushing to `oss` remote is intentionally disabled.
# To publish changes to OSS, cherry-pick or patch them manually from the OSS repo.
